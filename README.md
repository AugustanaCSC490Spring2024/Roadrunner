Wearable AI assistant involving voice recognition as input and output as LLM chatbot
Agree to work on a group of 4
Decide which part to work on

Hardware (raspberry pi 4, microphone, wires)
Collect voice
Speech to text
Carry around us every day. Have a SD card to store
Output audio files
LLM model (data collection, training, inference)
Data collection
from bunch of audios files
Voice recognition
Detect the voice who is who (mention name). Identify people
Filter background noise
Text LLM model


Infrastructure (how to handle the communication between client and LLM model) - python, flask, db for 


Client (mobile app or website serve as a chatbot/ assistant) 


Technologies
Hardware (Viet)
4-5 Raspeberry PI 4
SD Cards

Wearable accessories
LLM model (Stephen) - Everyone
Voice recognition

Next Step:
Create own discord chat, weekly updates. Noting down = writing the paper
Write proposal (why/ motivation, the impact, method)
Write design documents, low level. Ingest from papers, documents, online articles



Voice recognition: detect voice with people identity
Find existing model/ architecture on Github
