We are building a wearable AI assistant that helps people remember and reflect on their daily conversations.

By using voice recognition, this assistant can tell who's speaking and turn spoken words into valuable insights. It's designed to be carried around every day, making it easy for users to interact with and get useful information from their conversations. The goal is to make people more mindful of their interactions and improve their memory and critical thinking by engaging more with others or even themselves by providing a reflective and interactive platform for reviewing and analyzing daily communications.

The primary target audience is tech-savvy students who engage in a high volume of daily conversations.

Stay tuned for the update.
