 I'm damn straight, you are gay, no you're not. What are you gay? What am I running? Why are you gay? Because I'm not gay. I would like the reason, the taxi off. I don't know where is it coming from? Wait, what? It's fine. It's just that I'm not gay. I'm not gay. I'm not gay. I'm not gay. I'm not gay. I'm not gay. I'm not gay. I'm not gay. I'm not gay. I'm not gay. It's just there's something in here. That's good. It's running. Is that hallucinarian? No, it's running right now. And it's sending it to the end drop, endpoints, and converted. I'm like, oh. Let's go. Is it better if we can have a physical button on the Raspberry Pi? Because when we attach it, it's like here, right? Can we go click that? And they're going to record for like 30 minutes and then stop.
