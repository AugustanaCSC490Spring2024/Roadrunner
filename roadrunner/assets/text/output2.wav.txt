 Yeah, that's client making work with API because right now we don't have an UI. For Infra we improve. I mean, anything that hardware and the client need, we need to support Infra. For the model, we can probably start looking at the building now on Firetruck model. And then now on embeddings because right now we use our mobile AI. We don't have to use that. If it costs money right now, we can just see if it can open and start. It's like we do it by ourselves. And basically, improve the database retriever thing, right? Because right now, the query is like we're in the beginning. We have a lot of people. We have a lot of requests. It's going to be very slow. Because right now we start embeddings.
